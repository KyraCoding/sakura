## What is Sakura?
Ever used one of those ".gg" websites for a videogame? Think tracker.gg, for example. Sakura aims to be that type of website, but for CTFtime.
The CTFtime website is great, sure, but also leaves much to be desired. For example, there is no way to see what 10 competitions are currently making up your rating score. 

## What does Sakura provide?
We provide team and user analytics as well as some CTFtime utilities. However, a major annoyance I've had with CTFtime is that their API is pretty bad. A major weakness, for example, is that you cannot see the competitions a team did in a given year. So I've written my own CTFtime API that is much improved in my opinion. 

## Current Services
As of this writing, Sakura is still in alpha and as such some features are not working yet.
